## 🎮 What Is the Buckshot Roulette Mod Menu?

The **mod menu** is a cheat overlay injected into Buckshot Roulette, giving you real-time access to game-manipulating features. It’s not a basic trainer — it’s a fully interactive interface where you can toggle game-breaking powers like **shell reveal**, **AI freeze**, **bullet override**, and even **force outcomes** with one keypress.

It’s like having the dev console — but way more powerful 🧠💻
